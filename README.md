Fake Messenger - A Lightweight, Self-Contained WebView App


Fake Messenger is a standalone, portable WebView-based app designed to provide a clean, distraction-free Messenger experience without forced Edge browser redirection.  

Why I Made This  
I wanted hands-on experience with C# development, despite having no prior formal or informal training in C# or .NET applications. Throughout the process, I used ChatGPT as my guide, learning as I went.  
 
The latest Messenger desktop app is just a WebView wrapper, but it forces all links to open in Microsoft Edge, regardless of your default browser settingsâ€”with no option to change this.  

I figured it shouldnâ€™t be that hard to create a lightweight, standalone applet that:  
âœ… Self-unpacks and runs from a single executable  
âœ… Uses very little memory  
âœ… Respects your default browser for all links  
âœ… Provides an uncluttered Messenger experience  
âœ… Runs without installation or registry changes  

More Than Just Messenger  
Although I built this specifically for Messenger, with just a few tweaks to the code, it could easily be a portable Discord applet, a wrapper for any web-based service, or even a dedicated web kiosk for a specific website.  

Key Features  
WebView2-based â€“ Uses Microsoft Edgeâ€™s WebView2 for smooth performance.  
Portable & Self-Contained â€“ No installation required; just run the .exe.  
Automatic Unpacking â€“ Extracts only the necessary files on first run.  
Minimal Memory Usage â€“ Runs efficiently with minimal system impact.  
Respects Your Default Browser â€“ External links open where you want them to.  
Focused, No Extra Clutter â€“ Just the website you choose, nothing else.  


This project was not only about solving a real annoyance but also about learning C# from scratch. With ChatGPT as my tutor, I built something functional while deepening my understanding of .NET development.  

If youâ€™re looking for a simple, no-nonsense web app wrapper, this might be exactly what you need. ðŸš€
